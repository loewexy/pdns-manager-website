## Getting started

This page guides you through the installation of PDNS Manager and
Powerdns as an authoritative nameserver on a Debian-based system. For other
systems you may have to adjust some steps.

### Prerequisites

In order to complete this tutorial, you have to:

 * Configure a MySQL or Maria DB server and a new empty database
on it, preferably with separate user credentials only for the DNS
stuff.

 * Install Apache

 * Use PHP in version 7.1 or above, and have the PHP apcu and json extension enabled

 * Make sure that you have PHP MySQL native driver installed and enabled

### Install PDNS Manager

In order to install PDNS Manager, go to [Download](download.md) and get
the latest stable version. Unpack the archive and put the content in a
folder on your system (in the tutorial we will use /var/www/html). Configure
an Apache VHost with a config like the following:

```
<VirtualHost _default_:443>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost

    ServerName pdns.example.com

    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/frontend

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
    RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule !^/api/\.* /index.html [L]

    Alias /api /var/www/html/backend/public
    <Directory /var/www/html/backend/public>
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
        RewriteRule ^ /api/index.php [QSA,L]
    </Directory>

</VirtualHost>
```

Here, we assume that the hostname is "https://pdns.example.com".

To start the installation, open a browser and navigate to
"https://pdns.example.com/setup".

Here, you have to supply the database credentials:

* Host
* Username
* Password
* Database name
* Port

Provide a username and password for the first administrative user
of PDNS Manager.

After you have completed all necessary steps, press **Setup**.
Once the installation finished, you will be redirected to the login page where
you can now log in using the username and password you provided earlier.

### Install and configure Powerdns

Install Powerdns and the MySQL backend from the package sources:
```bash
sudo apt-get install pdns-server pdns-backend-mysql
```

Afterwards open */etc/powerdns/pdns.conf* with an editor of your choice
and enter the following:
```
allow-axfr-ips=127.0.0.1 <ip of your secondary nameserver>
config-dir=/etc/powerdns
daemon=yes
disable-axfr=no
guardian=yes
local-address=0.0.0.0
local-port=53
master=yes
slave=yes
module-dir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pdns
setgid=pdns
setuid=pdns
socket-dir=/var/run
version-string=powerdns
include-dir=/etc/powerdns/pdns.d
```

Replace &lt;ip of your secondary nameserver&gt; with the ip of your
secondary nameserver if it will get its data via AXFR, otherwise just
leave it out.

Now you have to supply the configuration for the MySQL backend.
Open */etc/powerdns/pdns.d/pdns.local.gmysql.conf* with an editor of
your choice and configure it as follows:

```
launch=gmysql

gmysql-host=localhost
gmysql-port=3306
gmysql-dbname=pdns
gmysql-user=pdns
gmysql-password=pdns
gmysql-dnssec=no

```
Replace the parameters with those matching your setup.

You can now restart powerdns and it should be up and running.
```
sudo service pdns restart
```

Have fun with your new DNS Server.
